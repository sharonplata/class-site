      <p>And thinking about our environment here in this digital space (social media), how difficult it is to draw the lines of how it's a fun tool at times, allowing me to be creative, curate content, stay in touch with friends or connect with people who inspire me-</p>
      <p>Yet how easily it can become unhealthy, where the pressure to preserve a polished, aesthetically-pleasing hence desireable image forms habits that don't serve well and warps one's image of themselves and/or others. To then feel lesser or more alone despite being connected. HOw heavily social media actually influences my outlook or motivations without me even realizing half the time.</p>
      <p>So I think about these things and try to stay mindful, keep myself in check, and also put out there that I hope others know that their most authentic self IS enough.</p>
      <p>Social media is just a thin slice of real life and real people</p>
